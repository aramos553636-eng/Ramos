# Java Linear Data Structure
CCE 105 2803 Linear Data Structure Activity

This is a simple code featuring the four Linear Data Structure Stack,
Queue,
Linked List,
Circular Linked List. Using Java Language.

Features:

- Stack→ push, pop, display
- Queue → enqueue, dequeue, display
- Linked List → insert at end, delete at beginning, display
- Circular Linked List → insert, delete, display

 # Brief Explaination of How it works
 For this code linear Data Structures upon running the code it will ask the user to which data structures he/she want  to use and then after choosing it will show another choices wither the user will add and value to that specific data  structure, delete or display the value and for this code since I did not put a value to each data structure the user  should firstly add a value before choosing the display feature. And each Data Structures has it's own method on how to add, delete or display the value inputed. Check out the Features above to see the differences of each data structures in terms of adding, deleting, and displaying the given value
